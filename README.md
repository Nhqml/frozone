*AppING 2022 - Final project*

## What

The goal of this project was to create 2 modules / libs in the C language that
would allow to retrieve live information on a system (running processes, logged
users, opened files, etc...), and freeze those resources.

This project is divided in 2 libs:

- `carto`, which contains code to retrieve information on a system
- `freezer`, which contains code to freeze some resources of a system
