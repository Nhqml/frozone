      Finding triggers whenever there is a strcpy or strncpy used.
      This is an issue because strcpy does not affirm the size of the destination array
      and strncpy will not automatically NULL-terminate strings.
      This can lead to buffer overflows, which can cause program crashes
      and potentially let an attacker inject code in the program.
      Fix this by using strcpy_s instead (although note that strcpy_s is an
      optional part of the C11 standard, and so may not be available).

      Finding triggers whenever there is a strcat.
      strcat can be used to exploit a buffer overflow.
      Use strncat instead, and check the size of the dst buffer thoroughly.
